As I've moved throughout this course, one of the things I've noticed is how coding/programming continues to build upon itself. Starting with basic code to print out a simple "HELLO WORLD" phrase, and moving from that to building entire web applications, every step up in complexity relies on the simplicities of past work. Everytime I would move from one part of the course to the next, I would notice that things that I learned how to do myself in the last section, is now done for you with the implementation of a new framework or dependency. For instance moving from Sinatra into Rails there is so much legwork from setting up Rake, creating attribute_accessors, and writing out get and post methods for individual routes. All of that is simplified moving into rails. Even simple functionality like adding the shotgun gem to a sinatra application is included for you when moving into Rails. This kind of progression continues as you get further into the course, from Rails into JavaScript and Javascript into React and Redux. It sort of feels like a double edged sword though. Having all of these different functions done for you can easily make you lazy and forget how to actually do them yourself. I find that I frequently need to go back to previous lessons to remind myself of how certain things actually work into the bigger picture of larger frameworks.
