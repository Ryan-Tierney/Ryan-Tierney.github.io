I have done tons of projects over the course of my learning career. However, I think here at Flatiron is the first time I can think of having to do projects, where the subject matter was completely mine to choose. Its both equally liberating, and unnerving. Every project has its parameters, goals and checkmarks you need to hit, but outside of those parameters, Flatiron's projects are completely at your own discretion. I loved the liberty of being able to choose subject matters that meant something to me. But I also spent a lot of time second guessing myself about which kind of projects would look good in a portfolio. This ultimately led me to restarting projects with different ideas on several occasions. I tossed around ideas of making all of my projects be games. However, I figured I should go for a more balanced portfolio that showed off more of a diverse skill set. Ultimately I feel its my indecision and restarting of projects that led to this bootcamp taking longer than I would have liked.
