I have started down many paths in my life. I've learned to play music, played sports, learned audio engineering, and taught myself how to cook. For one reason or another I've never felt like an imposter doing any of those things. However starting this coding journey was very different. It's hard to explain it, but there have been so many times througout this course when I have questioned if this was going to work out. I've felt like I wasn't learning, like I was pretending to be a programmer and I'm not really sure why. But for every moment that I doubted my future in this field, I also gained clarity and confidence and proved myself wrong time and time again. With every lesson completed, and every project assessment I passed, I felt more and more like the real deal. It helps to know that this is an issue that lots of people deal with when coming into this field in particular. It also helps that it seemed at almost every turn there was someone with Flatiron explaining how to cope with the mental stress of it all. I don't know if I'll get to a point where I don't doubt myself or feel like giving up. But through this course I've learned that even though I feel that way, I have what it takes to push through it and meet any challenge that is put before me.
