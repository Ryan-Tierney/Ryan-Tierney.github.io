Throughout my coding journey there has been one aspect of coding and webdesign that has stuck out as my favorite. I can not get enough of designing and organizing my web applications with CSS and HTML. A lot of the times when I'm working on and lesson or project. I'll go through 2 or 3 different types of layouts for the pages, I'll find something I really like and stick with it but as I move through the project I start thinking about what else I could do with it. It kind of reminds me of reorganizing my room. You get use to the way your room looks and eventually it gets a little stale. Then one day you move the bed to a different wall, reorganzing all of your knick-knacks and dresser drawers and all of a sudden your room feels fresh and exciting again. Creation is my passion in every form and I love being able to take an idea in my head and flesh it out on a webpage. I have a little background using photo and video editing software for a previous degree, and HTML and CSS make me recall a great deal of the stuff I worked with.
