Why did I decide to get into coding/software development. There are a lot of different reasons honestly. One, I love creating things. I love getting to express myself. Starting with nothing and brainstorming ideas. Two, technology based jobs are where the world is going/already is. I wanted to make sure that I was heading into a career field where I knew the skillset would always be needed. My most important reason, however, is 100% getting out of my current career, which is working for Dominos Pizza. I have worked for this company for almost 9 years now and I've had my fill. I've worked every position imaginable all the way up to running my own store. It was during that time that I decided that I was done. So maybe it was desperation that led me to turn to coding, but I feel pretty strongly that this is a good fit for me.
