It didn't take long starting my coding journey that I ran into my first hiccup. The first handful of lessons were easy enough to understand. Methods, looping, command line applications. All of it seemed easy enough to grasp, but then we got to iteration. Iteration was my first issue when learning how to code how to take an array of items and run a method or function through each item in it. Looking back now it feels crazy that it gave me so much trouble, but at the time it felt like a warning sign that it only gets harder from here. I feel like this was my point in coding where a lot of symbols start getting thrown in. All of a sudden I was dealing with pipes | |, brackets [ ], curly braces { }, and iterators like each and map. Much more powerful code than anything I had dealt with previously. A lot of my confusion came with return values, and the differences of what would be returned and created when using specific iterators. This was the first sign of trouble on my coding journey, but in retrospect it was also the first of many hills I overcame.
