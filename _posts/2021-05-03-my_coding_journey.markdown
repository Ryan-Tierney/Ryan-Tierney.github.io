Lets wrap this up! This is has been a far longer journey than I anticipated. I started with Flatiron back in September of 2019. I thought I would easily be able to finish within a year, but setbacks hit hard and frequent. I lost internet for a large portion of time due to hurricanes in my area. I lost family members, changed jobs, and of course COVID. I started to get really down on myself and feel like I wouldn't finish. I've always been afraid of failure and avoided risk because of it. Starting this journey was easily the biggest risk I've ever taken. I can see the end in sight I'm so close, just one more Assessment to pass and I'll be finished. 

In the beginning I was nervous but excited. I love creating things and getting to express myself and coding is used to make up so much of what I do with creation. From video games to music, coding/programming plays such a huge part in all of it. I have been desperate to get out of my current job and into something I can consider a career and I know its going to be in this field. From the moment I finished that first CLI GEM, I knew that this was a future and path that I could be happy with. 

For the GEM, I decided to create a NFL DRAFT sort of info sheet. I scraped all of the information on potential draft candidates for the 2020 draft from NFL.com and organized the information in a CLI application. Scraping and Iterating through an array of 50 draft candidates and all their attributes and bios proved a good challenge for me first project. Practically speaking this project is dated and doesn't really have much use in 2021 but can easily be changed to adjust for future draft classes.

Through Sinatra and Rails I would work on creating databases for movies and video games. I created a movie rental service with Rails and a video game backlog in Sinatra. Users could log in and create accounts and then with the Movie Rental service you could rent and review movies and with the video game backlog you could create a list of games that you would want to play but didn't have the time for them. Authorization proved to be the biggest hurdle with these projects. Especially in the Rails project with implementing Omniauth for outside authorization.

I switched over to game development for the Javascript project and created a spoof of the worlds hardest game. Again I implemented an authorization feature to allow the game to keep track of comments and highscores. This was by far my favorite project to make. 

With my final project I created a social media clone centered around creation. The idea was I would be able to use this to display my different portfolio projects. React and Redux absolutely pushed me to my limits. Im not proud to admit that this projet took me a couple months to finish mostly because of indecisiveness.

I've learned so much in these past 18 months and I'm so excited to keep learning. There have been so many things that I've seen outside of the projects that I've made that I want to learn how to do. I can't thank Flatiron and their staff enough for everything I've been through and I can't wait to see what the future holds for my career in coding
